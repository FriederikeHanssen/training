## 0. Warmup

check material

### 0.1 Prerequisites

### 0.2 Starting Point

## 1. Read in samplesheet

### 1.1. Read in samplesheet with splitCsv

read in file with splitCsv

Straight up the same content as splitting and grouping

### Takeaway

In this section, you've learned:

- **Reading in a samplesheet**: How to read in a samplesheet with `splitCsv`
- Assign columns to fields in meta map. why is this useful (Objective: Learn about maps and how to add values)

---

## 2. Create a new meta map key

Run a module; maybe something conceptually like a QC module
Assign a new value in the meta map following the QC module (Objective: tweak the map with computed values)

### Takeaway

In this section, you've learned:

- **Creating custom keys**

---

## 3. Group data with matching value in the meta map


Repeat a grouping example, using this new value as grouping or branching decider (Objective: use the meta map to decide on workflow paths)
Run a module with the groups

### Takeaway

In this section, you've learned:

- **Extracting an arbitray value to group or filter on**

---

## 4. Publishing location based on meta map value

tweak the publishing directory based on a field in the meta map (Objective: use the meta map in the module)

### Takeaway

In this section, you've learned:

- **Tweaking directives using meta values**

---

## 5. Tweak tool arguments based on meta map value

tweak the publishing directory based on a field in the meta map (Objective: use the meta map in the module)

### Takeaway

In this section, you've learned:

- **Tweaking script section based on meta values**
